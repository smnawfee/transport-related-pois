# Transport-related-POIs
A comparison between authoritative and user-generated transport-related points of interest
## Summary
In this study, we explore the spatial distribution of user-generated transport-related POIs from OpenStreetMap (OSM) against an authoritative dataset for the Greater London. While the OSM transport POIs and their sub-categories (Bus stops and Parking) exhibit higher frequency, they tend to concentrate at fewer locations (central part of the area overall but not for the sub-categories). This indicates that the spatial distribution of user-generated POIs varies between categories, highlighting systematic differences between user-generated and authoritative datasets This is a pilot of a larger distributional study on a range of POIs to understand their fitness-of-purpose in different scenarios.
## Datasets
In total we extracted 821,052 POIs from OSM in January 2020, source: https://www.geofabrik.de/data/download.html (Accessed in February 2021)
A total of  355,904 POIs from Ordnance Survey (OS) in September 2019 source: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ (Accessed in February 2021)
## Methods
## Major findings
1. Overall, the transport-related POIs are more represented in OSM than in OS (almost 2.5 times higher), with 6,777 POIs in OSM against 26,134 in OS. However, a similar number of bus stops are found in both datasets, while a substantially larger number of parking facilities are available in OSM compared to OS. However, if we look at the ‘Bus stop’ or ‘Parking’ the spatial distribution is different. The bus stops of the northernmost and southern areas are more represented through OSM than the central part, whereas, the parking POIs are concentrated to the east of central London. 
2. In terms of spatial distribution, we find that, although the total number of POIs is higher in the OSM datasets they are very highly concentrated in central London.
